# Predicting Fantasy Football Points Scored Using Linear Regression

This was my first independent project at Metis. I ran Linear Regression models over NFL player statistics
in order to predict the player's fantasy football points scored for next season. This project was completed
over 2 weeks, including time to prepare for a presentation. I scraped fantasy data from ESPN and Pro Football
Reference, cleaned it in Python. I then ran Linear Regression models and used some functions to iterate over
different lambda values for LASSO and RIDGE regularization, to find the optimal lambda. After using L1 regularization to select features, I ran a final Linear Regression model on those select features. Finally 
I ran some predictions for next year, I created graphs to visualize the model, and I scored the model.
